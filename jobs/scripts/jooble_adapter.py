"""Normalization adapter for Jooble's keyed job-search API.

Jooble requires a POST request with a JSON body ({"keywords": ...}) and an
API key issued to a real, approved account -- a GET request with the same
parameters returns nothing at all (verified directly against the live API).
The key is never stored in sources.ttl or any committed file: it is read
from the JOOBLE_API_KEY environment variable at request time by
live_sources.fetch_json_http, which also builds the real endpoint URL
(https://jooble.org/api/<key>) only in memory, never logging it.
